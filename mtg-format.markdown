Rules
=====

Deck construction rules
-----------------------
1. Players choose a legendary creature as the commander for their
   deck.
2. A card’s colour identity is its color plus the colour of any mana
   symbols in the card’s rules text. A card’s color identity is
   established before the game begins, and cannot be changed by game
   effects. The cards in a deck may not have any colours in their
   color identity which are not in the colour identity of the deck’s
   commander.
3. A *\<Format Name\>* deck respective minimum and maximum size is
   determined as follows.
   1. The default minimum size for a deck is 100 cards. The default
      maximum size for a deck is 100 cards.
   2. If a card requires your deck to contain at least a certain
      number of cards more than the minimum deck size, your maximum
      deck size is increased by that number.
4. With the exception of basic lands, no two cards in the deck may
   have the same English name. Some cards (e.g. Relentless Rats) may
   have rules text that overrides this restriction.
5. In addition to the deck, a *\<Format Name\>* deck may have a
   sideboard of up top 3 cards. The same colour identity restrictions
   apply to cards in a sideboard.
6. At the start of the game, a certain point limit is determined. The
   recommended point limit is 10. Certain cards are attributed point
   limits. A deck list main not contain cards totaling a higher point
   count thant the choosen point limit.

Play Rules
----------
1. Players begin the game with 40 life.
2. Commanders begin the game in the Command Zone. While a commander is
   in the command zone, it may be cast, subject to the normal timing
   restrictions for casting creatures. Its owner must pay {2} for each
   time it was previously cast from the command zone; this is an
   additional cost.
3. If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that card was put
   into that zone since the last time state-based actions were
   checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. If a commander
   would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its
   owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement
   effect may apply more than once to the same event.
4. Being a commander is not a characteristic [MTG CR109.3], it is a
   property of the card and tied directly to the physical card. As
   such, “commander-ness” cannot be copied or overwritten by
   continuous effects. The card retains it’s commander-ness through
   any status changes, and is still a commander even when controlled
   by another player.
5. If a player has been dealt 21 points of combat damage by a
   particular Commander during the game, that player loses a game.
6. Commanders are subject to the Legend rule; a player cannot control
   more than one legend with the same name.
7. Abilities which bring card(s) you own from outside the game into
   the game may only bring them from the sideboard.
